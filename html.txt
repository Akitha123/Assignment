                <h1>TURTLES</h1>
                <p>Turtles are reptiles that have been around for more than 220 million years,<br> making them one of the oldest reptile groups. They are fascinating creatures with unique characteristics,<br> such as their protective shell and ability to retract their heads and limbs into their shells for protection.<br>

                    Turtles can be found in various environments such as oceans, rivers, lakes, and even deserts.<br> There are over 350 species of turtles, with the largest being the leatherback sea turtle,<br> which can grow up to 7 feet in length and weigh over 2,000 pounds.<br>
                    
                    Turtles play an important role in their ecosystem as they help to control populations of certain aquatic<br> plants and animals.They also provide a source of food for many predators, such as birds and other reptiles.<br>
                    
                    Unfortunately, many species of turtles are endangered due to human activities such as habitat destruction,<br> overhunting, and pollution. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect these incredible animals<br> and ensure their survival for future generations.</p>
